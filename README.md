# RandTRO

The RandTRO is a Java project created for the Hacklahoma Hackathon 2024. 
The project outputs provided Retro-futuristic images at random when pressing the SPACE Key.

Our project uses 3 Java importations, each using extensions for Java JPanel, JFrame, and URL APIs.

Modifications:
- int width, int height
    --> Changes frame size to desired pixel resolution.
    --> Highly recommend using DEFAULT 1080p setting resolution.

- arrOfPictures
    --> Add/Remove image links from the array.
    --> CREATE a short URL link and paste it within
        the arrOfPictures[] array as a String
        (e.g. "https://example.com/html")

        --> Recommend using short URL Websites to receive a shortened link
            link. (Ex: https://is.gd/create.php)
